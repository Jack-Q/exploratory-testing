| Item         |  Description          |
|:------------:|:----------------------|
| Potential problems | Everything unforseen by planned testing techniques |

## Representative cases
* Skilled exploratory testing of the full product
* Rapid testing & emergency testing (including thrown-over-the-wall test-it-today)
* Troubleshooting / follow-up testing of defects.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

## Strengths
* Customer-focused, risk-focused
* Responsive to changing circumstances
* Finds bugs that are otherwise missed

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

## Blind spots
* The less we know, the more we risk missing.
* Limited by each testerâ€™s weaknesses (can mitigate this with careful management)
* This is skilled work, juniors are not very good at it.
