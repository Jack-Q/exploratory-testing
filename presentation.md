## Basic Description

| Item         |  Description          |
|:------------:|:----------------------|
| Tag line     | Simultaneous learning, planning, and testing |
| Objective    | Simultaneously learn about the product and about the test strategies to reveal the product and its defects |
| Testers      | Explorers |
| Coverage     | Hard to access |

////////////////////////////////////////

(Continued)

| Item         |  Description          |
|:------------:|:----------------------|
| Potential problems | Everything unforseen by planned testing techniques |
| Activities   | Learn, plan, and test at the same time |
| Evaluation   | Varies |
| Complexity   | Varies |
| Harshness    | Varies |
| SUT readiness | Medium to late: use cases must work |

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

## Representative cases
* Skilled exploratory testing of the full product
* Rapid testing & emergency testing (including thrown-over-the-wall test-it-today)
* Troubleshooting / follow-up testing of defects.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

## Strengths
* Customer-focused, risk-focused
* Responsive to changing circumstances
* Finds bugs that are otherwise missed

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

## Blind spots
* The less we know, the more we risk missing.
* Limited by each tester's weaknesses (can mitigate this with careful management)
* This is skilled work, juniors are not very good at it.

### What is Exploratory Testing?
#### Quote 
> a style of software testing emphasizing the personal freedom and responsibility 
 of the individual tester to continually optimize the value of her work by treating
 test-related learning, test design, test execution, and test result interpretation 
 as mutually supportive activities running in parallel throughout the project.
 <br />-- Cem Kaner
////////////////////////////////////////
#### Simplified
the testing that design and execution are performed at the same time, as an opposite to the scripted testing
  - no definition in advance
  - no plan to follow preciously
  - *scripted testing*: not fully opposite to it, since the scripted testing still contains interesting details that are uncovered
  - *"ad hoc"*: test the testing that performed completely without previous planning and filly according to the interesting of tester (improvised, impromptu)

Note:
* *Plainest* explanation, with some uncompleted compare with *scripted testing* and *"ad hoc" testing*
* the scripted testing doesn't mean complete coverage of testing details (leaves blanks for exploratory actions),
  whereas the exploratory testing doesn't means no preparation as instruction at all.
////////////////////////////////////////
#### Decomposing the term
the exploratory testing consists of both "exploratory" and "testing"
  - *exploratory*: emphasize on the freedom and personality of action (testing) executor.
    + often performed by individual
    + simultaneously learning from the situation and planning for next action, then perform the action instantly
  - *testing*: perform specific task with the subject testing unit and compare the result with expectation

Note:
* this section try to explain the definition of ET from its literal terms
* *exploratory* is not limited to the testing field, but also the design, development, etc.
////////////////////////////////////////
#### Other definitions

### Basic workflow of Exploratory Testing

  * learning: collect &amp; abstract related information
  * design: ignite the sparks of testing 
  * execution: doing the test and collect the result
  * interpretation: 

////////////////////////////////////////
#### Learning
Learning: collect &amp; abstract information related to testing subject
  - learn from anything that can guide us in what to test, how to test, or how to recognize a problem
  - possible source of the learning process including existing project documentation (requirement, design spec, manual, etc),

### Application concerns
#### Track the result: how to track the result of the testing?

////////////////////////////////////////
#### Support tools: any toolkit support the ET?
* the existing tooling constraints the thinking of exploring
* some CASE tools contains sort of support for manage the ET process
